# Keylogger
#Key Features:
  1. It records keys to a temporary string, encrypts them and saves them to file named TestData.txt in "MyDocuments" folder.
           
           Note:You can specify custom folder by setting folder variable.
  2. After some time, the file is decrypted to a new file named "new.text", then it is sent to the discord server and then the file is deleted              permanently.
          
          Note: To change time of decrypting, change the if condition shown below in range of 3000-4000, which is about every 5 minutes.
